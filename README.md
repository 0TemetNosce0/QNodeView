QNodeView
=========

Qt5 suite that supports displaying and editing nodes in a graph-like flow. Similar to Unreal Kismet, Frostbite 3 Schematics or Allegorithmic Substance Designer UIs.

NOTE: Currently requires C++11, but wouldn't be difficult to remove this. Qt5 has some nice C++11 time savers, though if enough people complain, I'll remove this dependency and revisit the dark ages :)
